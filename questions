Future goals & features: what would you add if you kept working on this project?

my future goals and features would be adding a timer in the game, add more levels,
add a button for the start game screen and loading for the start screen as well,
also I would change the character and make it look more like a character than a square
and that's pretty much it, those are the only things I would add in my game if I kept
working on my project.

Please continue to monitor this list as it may grow but for now your requirements include:


	
Game instructions
	A "landing screen"
	A score
	A way to win and/or
	A way to lose 
	In-line comments which describe your code
	Must be object-oriented (you've all done this but have some variables that can 
    probably be compiled into an object instead of just floating)
